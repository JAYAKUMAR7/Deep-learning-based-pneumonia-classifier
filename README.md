The seven CNN models used are:

          -> Simple CNN Model.
          -> CNN Model With Data Augmentation layers and Dropout layers.
          -> CNN Model with only Dropout layers.
          -> CNN Model only with Augumentation layers.
          -> CNN Model with two different augumentation layers.
          -> CNN Model with Data Augumentation layer and more dense layers.
          -> CNN Model that uses Filters in all the Layers.
          
Activation function used:

          ReLU
          
Optimizers used:

          -> Adam.
          -> Adamax.
          -> RMSprop
          -> SGD.
          -> AdaDelta.
